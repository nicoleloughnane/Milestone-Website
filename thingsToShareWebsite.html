        <h4>"Sweater Weather" - The Neighbourhood</h4>

        <!--Song lyrics-->
        <details>
            <summary>Lyrics</summary>
            <h3>Verse 1</h3>
       <p> 
           All I am is a man <br>
        I want the world in my hands <br>
        I hate the beach but I stand <br>
        In California with my toes in the sand <br>
        Use the sleeves of my sweater <br>
        Let's have an adventure <br>
        Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered <br>
        Touch my neck and I'll touch yours <br>
        You in those little high waisted shorts, oh <br>
    </p>
    
        <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
    <p>
        She knows what I think about <br>
        And what I think about <br>
        One love, two mouths <br>
        One love, one house <br>
        No shirt, no blouse <br>
        Just us, you find out <br>
        Nothing that I wouldnâ€™t wanna tell you about, no <br>
    </p>
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        <p>
        'Cause it's too cold for you here <br>
        And now, so let me hold <br>
        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater <br>
    </p>

        <h3>Verse 2</h3>
        <p>
        And if I may just take your breath away <br>
        I don't mind if there's not much to say <br>
        Sometimes the silence guides a mind <br>
        To move to a place so far away <br>
        The goosebumps start to raise <br>
        The minute that my left hand meets your waist <br>
        And then I watch your face <br>
        Put my finger on your tongue <br>
        'Cause you love the taste, yeah <br>
        These hearts adore <br>
        Everyone the other beats hardest for <br>
        Inside this place is warm <br>
        Outside it starts to pour <br>
    </p>
        <h3>Pre-Chorus</h3>
        <p>
        Comin' down <br>
        One love, two mouths <br>
        One love, one house <br>
        No shirt, no blouse <br>
        Just us, you find out <br>
        Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about <br>
        No, no, no <br>
    </p>

        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        <p>
        'Cause it's too cold for you here <br>
        And now, so let me hold <br>
        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater <br>
        'Cause it's too cold for you here <br>
        And now, so let me hold <br>
        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater, woah <br>
    </p>

        <h3>Bridge</h3>
        <p>
        Woah, woah, woah <br>
        Woah, woah, woah, woah <br>
        Woah, woah <br>
        Woah, woah, woah, woah <br>
        Woah, woah <br>
    </p>

        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        <p>
        'Cause it's too cold for you here <br>
        And now, so let me  <br>
        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater <br>
        'Cause it's too cold for you here <br>
        Now, let me hold <br>
        Both your hands in the holes of my sweater <br>
    </p>

        <h3>Outro</h3>
        <p>
        And it's too cold, it's too cold <br>
        The holes of my sweater <br>

            <h3>Verse 1</h3>
            <p>
                Fly me to the moon <br>
                Let me play among the stars <br>
                And let me see what spring is like <br>
                On a-Jupiter and Mars <br>
                In other words, hold my hand <br>
                In other words, baby, kiss me
            </p>
            <h3>Verse 2</h3>
            <p>
                Fill my heart with song <br>
                And let me sing forevermore <br>
                You are all I long for <br>
                All I worship and adore <br>
                In other words, please be true <br>
                In other words, I love you
            </p>
            <h3>Verse 3</h3>
            <p>
                Fill my heart with song <br>
                Let me sing forevermore <br>
                You are all I long for <br>

           <h3> Chorus </h3>
           <p>
           I've been so good <br>
        I've been helpful and friendly <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        Why am I feeling empty? <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        I've been so good this year <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        But it's still getting harder <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        Where the hell is the karma? <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        I've been so good this year <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Verse 1 </h3>
        <p>
        Why are you asking me why? <br>
        My days and nights are filled with disappointment <br>
        Fine, oh, no, everything's fine <br>
        I'm not sure why I booked today's appointment <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Chorus </h3>
        <p>
        I've been so good <br>
        I've been helpful and friendly <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        Why am I feeling empty? <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        I've been so good this year <br>
        And I've been so good <br>
        But it's still getting harder <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        Where the hell is the karma? <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        I've been so good this year <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Verse 2 </h3>
        <p>
        What? Am I normal or not? <br>
        Am I crazier than other patients? <br>
        Right, I've done everything right <br>
        So where's the karma, Doc? I've lost my patience <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Chorus </h3>
        <p>
        'Cause I've been so good <br>
        I've been working my ass off <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        Still, I'm lonely and stressed out <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        I've been so good this year <br>
        And I've been so good <br>
        But it's still getting harder <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        Where the hell is the karma? <br>
        I've been so good <br>
        I've been so good this year <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Bridge </h3>
        <p>
        Ah, ah, ah <br>
        Ah, ah, ah <br>
        I've been so good this year <br>
        I've been so good this year <br>
        </p>

        <h3>Outro</h3>
        <p>
        Time, I know we're out of time <br>
        But what if sad thoughts come and I can't stop it? <br>
        Bye, I don't wanna say bye <br>
        If only I could keep you in my pocket <br>
        To give me some diagnosis of why I'm so hollow <br>
        Please give me instructions, I promise I'll follow <br>
        I tripped on my ankle and fractured my elbow <br>
        But doesn't that mean that the tour's gonna sell, though? <br>
        I try to explain the good faith that's been wasted <br>
        But after an hour, it sounds like complaining <br>
        Wait, don't go away, can I lie here forever? <br>
        You say that I'm better, why don't I feel better? <br>
        The universe works in mysterious ways <br>
        But I'm starting to think it ain't working for me <br>
        Doctor, should I be good, should I be good this year? <br>

        <h3>Verse 1</h3>
        <p>
        Well, I heard you crying loud <br>
        All the way across town <br>
        You've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl <br>
        As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself <br>
        Well, don't get lonely now <br>
        And dry your whining eyes <br>
        I'm just roamin' for the moment, sleazin' my backyard, so don't get <br>
        So uptight, you've been thinking about ditching me <br>

        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        <p>

        <h3>Verse 2</h3>
        <p>
        Oh, I heard it all before <br>
        So don't knock down my door <br>
        I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser <br>
        To try and slag me down because I know you're right <br>
        So go do what you like <br>
        Make sure you do it wise <br>
        You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there <br>
        You can't go forcing something if it's just not right <br>
        </p>
